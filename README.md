## Project Overview üìñ
This project is a coding interview prep platform based on Next.js server-side rendering, Spring Boot, Redis, MySQL, and Elasticsearch. Its live version is available at https://www.mianshiya.com and currently only operates in China. This repository implements the platform's core features, including the ability for administrators to create question banks, questions, and solutions, and to associate multiple questions with a question bank in bulk. Users can register, log in, search questions with full-text search, practice coding problems online, and view their practice history in a calendar format.

The platform enhances performance through the use of a connection pool, hot key detection, caching, and advanced data structures. Security is bolstered by rate limiting, circuit breakers, dynamic IP black/whitelisting, conflict detection for simultaneous logins, and multi-level anti-scraping strategies.

## Development Process
The project follows a step-by-step development strategy, divided into three phases:

1) In the first phase, the focus is on developing a basic coding platform using Next.js for server-side rendering and rapid development with Spring Boot applications. The main goal is to implement basic CRUD operations.

2ÔºâIn the second phase, the project expanded its functionality by incorporating several mainstream enterprise backend technologies, such as Redis caching and advanced data structures, Elasticsearch search engine, Druid connection pool, concurrent programming, and hot key detection.

3ÔºâIn the third phase, the project focused on optimizing security with implementations such as traffic control and circuit breaking using Sentinel, dynamic IP blacklisting/whitelisting with Nacos, conflict detection for simultaneous logins using Sa-Token, and multi-level anti-scraping strategies based on Redis. The final goal was to launch the project and ensure its availability.
